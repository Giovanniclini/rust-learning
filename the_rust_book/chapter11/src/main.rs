fn main() {
    // Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:
    //    - Set up any needed data or state.
    //    - Run the code you want to test.
    //    - Assert that the results are what you expect.
    // A test function in rust is a function annotated with the test attributed. (we used #[derive] in the past)
    // When you run your tests with the 'cargo test' command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or fails.
    // See 'adder' example.
