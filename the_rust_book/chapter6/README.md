# Chapter 6 â€“ Enums and Pattern Matching

This folder contains notes and code based on Chapter 6 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Enums**  
  Defining types that can represent multiple possible values or "variants".

- **Pattern Matching with `match`**  
  Exhaustively handling all possible variants using powerful pattern matching syntax.

- **Concise Conditional Matching with `if let`**  
  A simplified way to match a single pattern when you donâ€™t need full `match` semantics.

- **Early Returns with `let-else`**  
  Cleaner control flow using pattern destructuring with early exits on failure.

This chapter deepens your understanding of how Rust models complex and flexible data using enums, and how its expressive pattern matching helps write safe and concise code.
