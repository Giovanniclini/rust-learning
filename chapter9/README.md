# Chapter 9 â€“ Error Handling: `panic!`, `Result`, and Recoverable Errors

This folder contains notes and code based on Chapter 9 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`**  
  Halting execution when something goes wrong that cannot be reasonably handled, such as out-of-bounds access.

- **Recoverable Errors with `Result<T, E>`**  
  Representing operations that can fail and handling those failures using pattern matching and combinators like `unwrap`, `expect`, and `match`.

- **Propagating Errors**  
  Using the `?` operator to simplify error propagation in functions that return `Result`.

- **Defining Custom Error Types**  
  Implementing the `Error` trait and using custom types to describe failure modes more clearly and idiomatically.

This chapter teaches you how Rust encourages safe, explicit error handling. Youâ€™ll learn how to distinguish between unrecoverable and recoverable errors, write robust APIs, and leverage the type system to catch problems at compile time.
