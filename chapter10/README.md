# Chapter 10 â€“ Generics, Traits, and Lifetimes

This folder contains notes and code based on Chapter 10 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Generics**  
  Writing flexible and reusable functions, structs, enums, and methods that can operate over many different types without sacrificing type safety.

- **Traits**  
  Defining shared behavior using trait bounds, implementing traits for custom types, and using `impl Trait` for clearer function signatures.

- **Trait Bounds and Conditional Implementations**  
  Using `where` clauses to express complex constraints and providing trait implementations only when certain conditions are met.

- **Lifetimes**  
  Ensuring references are valid and safe by explicitly annotating how long they must live, and understanding the lifetime elision rules that simplify common cases.

This chapter deepens your understanding of Rustâ€™s powerful type system. You'll learn how to abstract over types and behavior, enforce compile-time guarantees, and write safe and expressive APIs through generics, traits, and lifetime annotations.
