# Chapter 7 â€“ Packages, Crates, and Modules

This folder contains notes and code based on Chapter 7 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Packages and Crates**  
  Organizing Rust code into reusable compilation and distribution units using `cargo`, `Cargo.toml`, and the crate system.

- **Modules and File Hierarchy**  
  Grouping related functionality using `mod`, and structuring code across files and folders.

- **Paths and Visibility**  
  Navigating the module tree using `self`, `super`, and `crate`, and controlling access with the `pub` keyword.

- **The `use` Keyword**  
  Bringing items into scope to simplify paths and improve code readability.

This chapter builds a solid foundation for organizing Rust programs. You'll learn how to create well-structured, maintainable projects by splitting code into modules, exposing clean public APIs, and managing dependencies through packages and crates.
