# Chapter 8 â€“ Common Collections: Vectors, Strings, and Hash Maps

This folder contains notes and code based on Chapter 8 of *The Rust Programming Language*.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- **Vectors (`Vec<T>`)**  
  Growable arrays that allow storing elements of the same type. Learn how to create, update, and access vector elements safely.

- **Strings**  
  UTF-8 encoded text in Rust. Understand the difference between `String` and `&str`, how to manipulate strings, and handle common pitfalls like indexing.

- **Hash Maps (`HashMap<K, V>`)**  
  Key-value storage for efficient lookup and mutation. Learn how to insert, access, and update values, and how ownership works with hash maps.

This chapter introduces Rustâ€™s most common collection types. You'll gain practical skills for working with dynamically-sized data structures and storing structured or textual information efficiently and safely.
